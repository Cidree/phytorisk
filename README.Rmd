`phytorisk` is an R package developed to quantify the risk of invasion of the oomycete *Phytophthora cinnamomi* Rands (Pc hereafter). Pc is a pathogen that infects plant's roots, and in many cases, kills the host. The dispersal of the pathogen depends on multiple factors, which are depicted in the next figure:

![Potential mechanisms of dispersal of Pc](man/figures/Fig1.jpg){#fig-dispersal width="825"}

a)  Movement of inoculum in the field due to diffusive root-to-root contact `mec_rootcontact()`

b)  Inoculum movement to roots in water particles within soil `mec_soilwater()`

c)  Dispersion of inoculum by domestic and wild animal movement `mec_zoospread()`

d)  Inoculum spread in surface water `mec_surfaceflow()`

## Installation

You can install the last stable version of `phytorisk` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
